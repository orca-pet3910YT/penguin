Hello, user!

This is **Linux Penguin 1.0**, a Linux-based OS by orca.pet3910YT!

Please make sure the computer you install this on is NOT one that is essential for something because it will have it's data wiped on the selected disk, so don't make any mistake when typing the drive!

## Will this work on my machine?

Maybe. As of now, the installer has only been tested on a VirtualBox machine, so I can't be sure it will always work.

## Can I access the internet?

No. There is no internet driver on this OS.

## How do I make sure I can recover the installation after selecting the wrong drive?

Please **make a backup or installation media drive**. The OS is meant to be installed if you know what you're doing.

## Can I install this on real hardware or a server?

Technically, yes. Practically, please don't. The Linux kernel Penguin operates on is modified and has crash dump SysRq sequences fully enabled.

That means every user, malicious or no, might intentionally crash the OS and corrupt data, even by just connecting a keyboard and pressing SysRq c (lowercase C) or SysRq A (uppercase A).
